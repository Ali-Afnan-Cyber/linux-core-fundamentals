# Linux File System & File Management – Hands-On Lab

## Overview
This repository documents a comprehensive hands-on lab covering **core Linux file system and file management operations**.  
The lab demonstrates practical command-line proficiency required for **Linux system administration, DevOps, cloud, and cybersecurity roles**.

All exercises were completed in a real Linux environment with direct command execution and validation.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Linux filesystem navigation and hierarchy understanding
- File and directory lifecycle management
- Command-line text editing
- File permissions and ownership control
- Pattern-based file operations (wildcards)
- File content inspection and searching
- Link management (hard & symbolic)
- Disk usage and storage analysis

---

## Lab Environment
- **OS:** Linux (Unix-like)
- **Interface:** Terminal / CLI
- **Tools:** GNU core utilities
- **Editors:** nano, vi

---

## Lab Coverage

### 1. Filesystem Navigation
- Identify current working directory
- Traverse directories efficiently
- Commands used:
  - `pwd`
  - `ls`, `ls -la`
  - `cd`, `cd ..`

---

### 2. Directory Management
- Create, remove, move, and rename directories
- Commands used:
  - `mkdir`
  - `rmdir`
  - `rm -r`
  - `mv`

---

### 3. File Management
- Create, delete, and inspect files
- Commands used:
  - `touch`
  - `rm`
  - `cat`
  - `less`
  - `echo`

---

### 4. Text Editing (CLI)
- Create and edit files directly from terminal
- Editors used:
  - `nano`
  - `vi`
- Core operations:
  - Insert mode
  - Save and exit workflows

---

### 5. File Permissions
- Inspect and modify access permissions
- Commands used:
  - `ls -l`
  - `chmod` (symbolic & numeric modes)
- Concepts:
  - User / Group / Others
  - Read, write, execute permissions

---

### 6. Ownership & Group Management
- Manage file ownership and group access
- Commands used:
  - `chown`
  - `chgrp`
- Practical use cases for multi-user environments

---

### 7. Wildcards & Pattern Matching
- Perform bulk operations efficiently
- Wildcards used:
  - `*`
  - `?`
- Commands used:
  - `cp`
  - `rm`

---

### 8. Viewing & Searching File Contents
- Inspect large files and filter data
- Commands used:
  - `head`
  - `tail`
  - `more`
  - `grep`

---

### 9. Links
- Create and analyze hard and symbolic links
- Commands used:
  - `ln`
  - `ln -s`
  - `ls -i`
- Concepts:
  - Inodes
  - Link counts

---

### 10. Disk Usage & Storage Analysis
- Monitor filesystem and directory space usage
- Commands used:
  - `df -h`
  - `du -sh`
  - `du -ah | sort -hr`
- Use cases:
  - Identifying large files/directories
  - Storage optimization

---

## Outcome
This lab validates **production-ready Linux fundamentals** applicable to:
- DevOps & Cloud Engineering
- System Administration
- Cybersecurity Operations
- Infrastructure Troubleshooting

---

## Notes
- Labs were completed hands-on in a live Linux environment.
- This repository serves as **documented proof of practical Linux competency**, not theoretical notes.
